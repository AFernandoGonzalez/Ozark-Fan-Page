	<h1>The Usual Suspects</h1>
</div>
<div class="content1">
	<p> We've all heard the expression, "its always the quiet ones!" Marty fits that idea perfectly. He and his family are unassuming and incredibly average by lifestyle but they are also all very intelligent. Something that becomes more and more of a factor as they use their wits to stay alive. However, they are not the only smart ones in the Ozarks! There is a host of wiley and unsavory characters they must outsmart or partner with in the Ozarks that are equally as intelligent. The Snells and the Langmores for example. They don't take kindly to new neighbors.</p>
