	<p>What is "Money Laundering" anyway? Well, its like this...</p>
	<p>Legitimate businesses are used to filter illegally gained funds back into the banking system and process or "clean" it so that its sources cannot be traced and it can be withdrawn as useable and technically "legal" currency. The way this works is by mixing the "dirty" money gained from some illegal activity with the "clean" money from the legitimate businesses, then depositing those funds in the bank as business profits. Won't the receipts show you didn't make that much? Not if the financial records are adjusted to hide the money by inflating invoices, business costs and revenues. Then paying out large sums of cash to suppliers run by the cartels for goods and services you'll never receive.</p>
	<h2>Money Laundering 101 - Clean Cash the "Marty Byrde" Way</h2>
	<ol class="howto">
		<li id="step1">Buy or start cash-based businesses</li>
			<ul class="descr">
				<li>Marty buys cash businesses with high operating costs. If they need renovations, all the better. Strip clubs, bars, and funeral homes seem to do the trick.</li>
			</ul>
		<li id="step2">Start a Few Shell Companies</li>
			<ul class="descr">
				<li>Cover your tracks! The money is transferred from US bank accounts to "shell" company accounts in foreign countries.  "Shell" companies are essentially fake companies that appear real on paper. However, in reality they have indiscernible owners and no physical location or employees. They also usually exist in places the IRS can't touch (like Panama). Once the money is processed through the shell, it is once again transferred to another standard account in another country, which is usually a checking account. </li>
			</ul>
		<li id="step3">Stop by the bank, then pick-up the clean laundry</li>
			<ul class="descr">
				<li>Once the money has been cleaned in the accounts the only thing left to do is pick it up. That cash is now squeaky-clean! Marty mentions that there are more than 3 Million terminals that can be used to do this. Good luck to any authority trying to piece together and track back the list of withdrawals from the $500 Million Marty has scrubbed clean!! Now, of course it sounds super easy since this is analyzing a TV show approach. In reality, I'm sure it's quite a bit more complicated than this. However, I think this is a pretty good general overview. The point is... DON'T TRY THIS!!! It probably won't end well for you. But you can have fun watching Marty get it done.</li>
